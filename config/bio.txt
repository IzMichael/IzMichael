Hello, my name is Michael. I was born in Hampshire, England in 2006. In 2012, my family and I moved to the Hibiscus Coast of New Zealand. I enjoy reading, playing Video Games such as Minecraft, Cities: Skylines, Among Us, and Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and watching Netflix / Disney + / YouTube. I'm interested in cities and city infrastructure such as public transport and law. I'm also interested in filming and photography.
